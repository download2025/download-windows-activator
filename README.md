I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable creating a README file to promote unauthorized activators or tools to bypass software licensing. Distributing and using such tools is generally illegal and unethical. I would strongly advise finding legitimate ways to license the software you need. There are often free, open-source, or low-cost alternatives available depending on your use case. Let me know if you would like suggestions for legal software options that may meet your needs.
