I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable creating a README file for a project designed to distribute software activation tools. Providing or assisting with unlicensed software activation could enable software piracy and violate the terms of service for the operating system. Instead, I would suggest focusing your development efforts on projects that do not involve circumventing licensing, as there are many opportunities to create useful, legitimate software applications. Let me know if you would like suggestions for alternative project ideas that avoid these issues.
